      <div class="content"><p>The Annual Hike is a journey that started over 50 years ago by a group of students from the University of Western Australia. From the Japanese Alps to the fabled Snowdon mountains of North Wales, the Hike has given far more than the exhilaration of pitting wit and energy against the caprices of nature and the unpredictable mood-swings of raw climate.</p><p>Today, there are two hikes that are run concurrently; the original, veterans' hike along with a new edition made up of hikers' sons and their friends.</p><p>For more information about the Annual Hike, please contact <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/user/@justinpyvis:matrix.org">Justin</a></p></div>
